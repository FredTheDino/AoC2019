# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the advent of code problems for the year 2019.

The solutions are written in Haskell and Rust, I couldn't decide
which so I'm using both, to get a grip for the languages and ease
that first month of use. It's also a nice way to see if the languages
work for me at all.
